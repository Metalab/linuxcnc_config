        Handler classes are instantiated in the following state:
        - the widget tree is created, but not yet realized (no toplevel window.show() executed yet)
        - the halcomp HAL component is set up and the widhget tree's HAL pins have already been added to it
        - it is safe to add more hal pins because halcomp.ready() has not yet been called at this point.

        after all handlers are instantiated in command line and get_handlers() order, callbacks will be
        connected with connect_signals()/signal_autoconnect()

        The builder may be either of libglade or GtkBuilder type depending on the glade file format.
